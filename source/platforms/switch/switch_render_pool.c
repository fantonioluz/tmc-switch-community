/*
 * switch_render_pool.c — a PERSISTENT libnx worker pool for the per-frame PPU
 * scanline render.
 *
 * The asset extraction uses switch_parallel_for (switch_parallel.c), which
 * spawns + joins threads per call — fine for a one-shot job, but creating
 * threads 60x/second for rendering would add per-frame latency and jitter.
 * This pool creates its worker threads ONCE and feeds them a "run body(ctx, i)
 * for i in [0,total)" job each frame via a generation counter + condvars, with
 * atomic work-stealing so uneven per-line cost still balances.
 *
 * Usage (from the render thread only — single producer):
 *     switch_render_pool_run(160, render_one_line, &ctx);
 * The first call lazily spawns the workers. The calling (main) thread also
 * participates as a worker, so total parallelism = spawned workers + 1.

/* Application mode exposes cores 0-2 (core 3 = OS). WORKERS = 0 → fully serial
 * render on the main thread, spawning NO worker threads, which leaves cores 1
 * AND 2 entirely free for the SDL audio mixing/callback thread. The render
 * worker threads (2, then 1) competed with audio for cores 1/2 and starved it
 * at the heavier widescreen width → crackle + audio slowdown. Since the PPU
 * render is NOT the fps bottleneck (the single-threaded game logic is — see
 * PERF_DOSSIER.md), serial render costs little fps but gives audio clean cores.
 * (Raise this again only if a future profile shows render is the bottleneck.) */
